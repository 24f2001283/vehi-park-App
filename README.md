## üìù Abstract  

The Vehicle Parking App is a multi-user Flask-based web application that allows users to manage 4-wheeler parking in multiple lots. It provides role-based dashboards for **Admin** and **User**, enables parking spot allocation, history tracking, and real-time visual summaries through integrated chart visualizations.

---

## üåü Core Functionalities  

### üë®‚Äçüíº Admin:  
- Add/edit/delete parking lots and auto-create parking spots.  
- Monitor and manage all bookings, users, and lot statuses.  
- Cascade delete functionality for related spots.  
- Visualize booking and occupancy stats using charts.  
- Search interface for user/bookings/lot information.  

### üßç User:  
- Register, login, and access personal dashboard.  
- View available lots and book or release parking spots.  
- Track booking history with cost and timestamps.  
- Access summary charts for personal usage insights.  

---

## üß± Database Schema  

> SQLite-based schema created using SQLAlchemy.  
> Models include: `User`, `ParkingLot`, `ParkingSpot`, `Booking`  
> Supports relations with cascading delete and timestamp tracking.
